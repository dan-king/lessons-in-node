# Lesson 5

This lesson introduces the [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) templating engine for Node.

The Express package for Handlebars can be found at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars).

Start with the package.json from [Lesson 4](../lesson-04)

Install the Express Handlebars view engine and add add it to your package.json from the command line:

````bash
npm install --save express-handlebars
````

A shortcut to the syntax above is

````bash
npm i -S express-handlebars
````
